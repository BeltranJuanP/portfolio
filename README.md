# portfolio

This is my portofolio

TODO: 
- fix my description
- add my projects
- phone improvements:
  - descriptions on projects don't really work
  - lines under the links dont disapear once you touch them
  - the shadows on projets loks out of place in landscape?
    maybe make them smaller at some sizes
  - the tech stack names dont disappear either ... this might be fine tho
  - the color change on the button doesn't turn back after clicking too
