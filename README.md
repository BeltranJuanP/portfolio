# portfolio

This is my work in progres portofolio

TODO: 
- fix my description
- add my projects
- phone improvements:
  - i don't like the way the modal looks on phone in general
    - maybe do a different modal for that case because yeah its just weird
      - could make modal_about section the whole screen add mail button and hide the contact one
  - descriptions on projects don't really work
    - can be solved by changing everything from hover to click
  - lines under the links dont disapear once you touch them -- FIXED
